            A butterfly is a (usually) day-flying insect of the order Lepidoptera. They are grouped together in the suborder Rhopalocera. Butterflies are related to moths, from which they evolved about 56 million years ago.[1] The earliest discovered fossil moth was 200 million years ago.[2]

The life of butterflies is closely connected to flowering plants. Their larvae (caterpillars) feed on plants, and their adults feed on flowers. They lay their eggs on the plants their caterpillars feed on. Butterflies have a long history of co-evolution with flowering plants. Many of the details of plant anatomy are related to their pollinators, and vice versa.[3] The other notable features of butterflies are their extraordinary range of colours and patterns, and their wings. These are discussed below.
